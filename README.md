# README

This is a small demo e-commerce app using Rails 7, Stimulus and Tailwind. 

From the home page a user can add an item to a list of favourites via a js action by clicking the star icon in the corner of that item's image. The favourites list can be accessed via the dropdown menu from the burger icon.

Clicking an item's image on the home page will direct a user to the item's information page. From here a quantity of the item can be added to the shopping cart via a js action. Additional js actions will also update the colour and number of the shopping cart icon in the header.
